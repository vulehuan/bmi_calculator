## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the `bmi_calculator` gem in your Ruby application:

```ruby
require 'bmi_calculator'

# Initialize weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters)
weight = 70
height = 1.75

# Calculate BMI
bmi = BMICalculator::Calculator.calculate(weight, height)
puts "Your BMI is: #{bmi}"

# Get BMI category
category = BMICalculator::Calculator.bmi_category(bmi)
puts "BMI Category: #{category}"
```

### Methods

- **`BMICalculator::Calculator.calculate(weight, height)`**: Calculates the BMI based on the provided weight and height.
    - **Parameters**:

        - `height`: The height of the individual in meters.
    - **Returns**: The calculated BMI rounded to two decimal places.

- **`BMICalculator::Calculator.bmi_category(bmi)`**: Returns the BMI category based on the calculated BMI.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `bmi`: The calculated BMI value.
    - **Returns**: A string indicating the BMI category ("Underweight", "Normal", "Overweight", "Obesity").

## Example

```ruby
weight = 65
height = 1.68

bmi = BMICalculator::Calculator.calculate(weight, height)
puts "Your BMI is: #{bmi}"               # Output: Your BMI is: 23.06
puts "BMI Category: #{BMICalculator::Calculator.bmi_category(bmi)}"  # Output: BMI Category: Normal
```
